I am a result and performance-driven software architect/consultant/developer with a gift for designing and implementing solutions with both performance and flexibility across the full stack.

I have more than a decade years enhancing businesses through the design and implementation of practical technology solutions in a variety of industries including healthcare, finance, insurance, white-collar automation, geospatial, retail, food, ecommerce, real estate, etc.

I am proficient in Agile (Scrum) software development methodology with a strong knowledge of SDLC:

Concept & Planning âžœ Solution Architecture/Design âžœ POC(MVP) âžœ TDD âžœ QA/UAT âžœ DevOps & CI/CD âžœ Release âžœ Maintenance

I am obsessed with providing our customers with solutions that are cost-effective, highly available, and secure.
